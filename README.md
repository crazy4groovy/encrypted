Encrypted Textarea
==================

Offline, client-side encrypted plaintext editor in an HTML file. All text is only persisted in an [encrypted](http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/) and password-protected state in localStorage when editing or in HTML when exported. To export decrypted plaintext, select all/copy/paste.
